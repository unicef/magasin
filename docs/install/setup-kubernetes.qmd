Magasin components are designed for installation within Kubernetes clusters. Major cloud providers offer the ability to set up these clusters, but for exploration and testing, you can create one on your desktop.

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you may proceed without this step.

For setting up a Magasin instance in a local cluster on a desktop, it is advisable to have a minimum of 32 GB of RAM.

# Setup a local cluster

## Option 1: Local cluster using Docker-desktop

In case you do not have a Kubernetes cluster, another easy way to set it up is through [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). It is available for: 

* [GNU/Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
* [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)


Once installed. In **Settings / Kubernetes **, enable Kubernetes. It will automatically install

Lastly, on a command line, create the new cluster and use it:

```sh
kubectl config set-context magasin --namespace default --cluster docker-desktop --user=docker-desktop
kubectl config use-context magasin
```

To ensure that the kubernetes cluster is the correct one check if the name corresponds to the
```sh
kubectl get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   48m   v1.28.2
```

```sh
kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   49m
kube-node-lease   Active   49m
kube-public       Active   49m
kube-system       Active   49m
```

## Option 2: Local cluster using Minikube

If you don't have a kubernetes cluster, for testing purposes, you can easily install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) in your desktop. Minikube is a kubernetes cluster created for practicing and learning purposes.

The full installation details are described in [https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

```bash
# GNU/Linux Debian like
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_latest_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i minikube_latest_amd64.deb
```
```bash
# Mac OS
brew install minikube
```
Once minikube is installed, please make sure to run:

```bash
minikube start
```
If your system does not have the command `kubectl` already installed, it is also recommended to add the [`kubeclt` alias](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/kubectl/)

::: {.callout-note}
Note that both of the two options above are just recommended for playing around without needing to deploy any infrastructure, but not for setting up an actual "shared" instance of magasin.

# Setup a cluster in a major cloud provider

Kubernetes enjoys broad support from major cloud providers, allowing you to choose based on your organization's preferences and compliance requirements. Here are links to their respective pages.

Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on the cloud is currently out of the scope of this documentation, however you can find more information in:

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal?tabs=azure-cli)
* [Kubernetes in Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/kubernetes/) 

* [Google Kubernetes Service (GKS)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 
* [Digital Ocean Kubernetes (DOKS)](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes)
