## The challenge

In today's data-informed world, governments and organizations face a monumental challenge: fragmented data spread across siloed systems. Departments, divisions, and units gather data independently, leading to inefficiencies and risks:

 * **Fragmentation in data tools and capacity**. Organizations, particularly those lacking centralized structures, often grapple with **data tool fragmentation**. This fragmentation is characterized by the use of diverse technologies across different teams, which can **impede resource mobility** and lead to technology duplication.
    
    Moreover, capacity issues frequently arise as a result of siloed work. This lack of integration exacerbates **resource allocation challenges**, thereby limiting the organization’s overall potential. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and unlocking the full potential of the organization.

*  **Myopic data analysis and lack of comprehensive insights**. Siloed data prevents organizations from gaining a holistic understanding of their operations and stakeholders, leading to shortsighted decision-making.

To overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of modern data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, organizations need a comprehensive set of tools. 

## Marketplace gaps

When we go to the global market we find several gaps.

1. **Overwhelming landscape**. Entering the world of data can be daunting, with a myriad of products each requiring trade-offs. Just look at the picture below that displays which was the DATA & AI Landscape already in 2019

2. **Data/AI Leaders are solving a specific problems set**. Most data systems are optimized for massive scale and low-latency, crucial for time-sensitive tasks like targeted advertising. However, not all organizations face such time-pressured scenarios. 

3. **Systems that require a high cost entry**. These data systems are generally not designed for low-end hardware or low cost of entry, further complicating the landscape for organizations exploring data solutions without having a deep pocket.

4. **End-to-end solutions are proprietary** Traditional end-to-end data platforms often come with proprietary restrictions, limiting flexibility and tying organizations to specific cloud vendors or industry niches. 

Therefore, find in the market that there is not an end-to-end, open source solution that has a low cost of entry, that sets a uniform but flexible approach for different teams and that can scale with the needs of the organizaitons.

Hence, it is observed in the market that there lacks a comprehensive, open-source solution. Such a solution would ideally have a low entry cost, establish a uniform yet adaptable approach for various teams, and possess the capability to scale in accordance with the evolving needs of organizations. This gap presents a significant opportunity for innovation and development in the field.

# Magasin was needed

![Core enabling capabilities](./images/enabling-capabilities.svg)

Our solution is a game-changer in the data landscape. We offer a democratized approach to data anaylsis, empowering organizations of all sizes and structures to harness the power of data without compromising on cost, flexibility and proprietary vendor lock-in. 

Magasin offers an open-source, cloud-native end-to-end solution covering data ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization. Our [architecture](./architecture.qmd) is composed of loosely coupled, mature open-source solutions.

Magasin fits the needs of any public or private organizations that generate data from multiple data sources, that realized the need of performing data Science, ML/AI at scale.​

For the public sector and NGO organizations it is a cross-sectoral tool that can be implemented at the national, subnational, or department level.​

For the private sector it fits any organization that wants to leverage data science to keep relevant and improve business outcomes​ with a low cost as barrier of entry​ and with full control of the data.


**Don't just keep up – lead the change with magasin and transform your organization's digital future today**.
