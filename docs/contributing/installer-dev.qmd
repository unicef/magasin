The `[install-magasin.sh](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/install-magasin.sh)` is a shell script that installs all the dependencies required to setup up all the helm charts that compose magasin. 

You can find more details on what it does in the [advanced installation page](../install/advanced.qmd)

It has a companion that is the `[uninstall-script.sh](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/uninstall-magasin.sh)`

The installer and uninstaller source code can be found under the [installer/]() folder within the main magasin repository.

## Installer tests

The installer includes various functionality and options; in order to verify these are working we have created a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions that runs several tests in different operating systems. 

To view the source code visit [install-tests.yaml](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/.github/workflows/install-tests.yml)
