title: "Step 3: Create a dashboard"
description-meta: Superset step
---

In the previous steps we did an [exploratory analysis](exploratory-analysis.qmd) that gave us the opportunity to learn about the data and what we could extract from it. After that we learnt to [automate the data ingestion](automate-data-ingestion.qmd), that is the process of gathering and processing the data though in a scheduled way.

So now, we have our ready to use dataset which is automatically updated. The last step on the process is to create a beautiful dashboard that we can share with the decission makers to help them to take the organization to the next level thanks to the use of data informed decissions. 

In magasin's open source architecture, [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is the business intelligence dashboarding tool that comes out of the box, but similarly to what we mentioned about MinIO, the loosely coupled architecture of magasin allows organizations to choose to leverage other tools that the organization may be already using such as PowerBI or Tableau.

Apache Superset can consume any SQL based database engine. However, we stored our data as `.parquet` files. To allow us to use file based datasets in the architecture we have [Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/), which basically allows us to consume these datasets using a SQL interface. Indeed, you can also query other formats such as CSV or JSON and Apache Drill will provide a SQL interface to query them. 

## Setup Apache Drill to connect to MinIO

1. Launch Apache Drill User interface

    ```sh
    mag drill ui
    ```

    ![Drill user interface home](../images/get-started/drill-ui-home.png)

Then in the "Storage" page within the "Disabled Storage Plugins" click on the Update button of S3. 

![Drill Update the S3 storage plugin ](../images/get-started/drill-ui-storage.png)

Modify the beggining of the JSON so it looks like: 
```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "connection": "s3a://magasin",
  "config": {
    "fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled": "false",
    "fs.s3a.path.style.access": "true",
    "fs.s3a.endpoint": "myminio-hl.magasin-tenant.svc.cluster.local:9000",
    "fs.s3a.access.key": "minio",
    "fs.s3a.secret.key": "minio123"
  },
  "workspaces": {
    "data": {
      "location": "/data",
      "writable": false,
      "defaultInputFormat": null,
      "allowAccessOutsideWorkspace": false
    },
    "root": {
      "location": "/",
      "writable": false,
      "defaultInputFormat": null,
      "allowAccessOutsideWorkspace": false
    }
  },
  "formats": { 
    # ...
    # KEEP THE REST OF THE FILE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL. 
    # ...
  }
}
```
Press **Update** button, and then the click on the **Enable** button.


Now, click on **Query** at the top navigation bar corner and submit this test query: 

```sql 
USE `s3`.`data`;
```

![Drill query UI](../images/get-started/drill-ui-query.png)

If every thing goes right, you should see something like:

![Success query result](../images/get-started/drill-ui-success-query.png)

## Setting up the Drill-Superset database connection


1. Lauch the Apache Superset user interface

    ```sh
    mag superset ui
    ```

2. As credentials, enter **`admin` / `admin`**

    ![Superset login page:](../images/get-started/superset-login.png)

   .
3. Go to top right corner and go to **Settings > Database connections** 

    ![Settings > Database connections](../images/get-started/superset-settings-database.png)
    .
4. Click on the + Database > Select Apache Drill as database

    ![ Database > Select apache drill](../images/get-started/superset-connect-to-database.png)
    .

5. Add the below SQLAlechemy URI and, then, click on **Test the connection**.

    ```sh
    drill+sadrill://drill-service.magasin-drill.svc.cluster.local:8047/dfs?use_ssl=False
    ```


    ![ Test connection](../images/get-started/superset-test-connection.png)
 
    This is a connection that comes out of the box with Apache Drill. If this works, it means that superset has access to Apache Drill. Now, we will use the storage we created earlier, the `s3` connection. 

6. If the connection suceeds, replace the string with the following and click on Test the connection

    ```sh
    drill+sadrill://drill-service.magasin-drill.svc.cluster.local:8047/s3?use_ssl=False
    ```


## Creating the Superset Dashboard

Ok, so we are in the final sprint to achieve our goal, but before we start, let's do a quick introduction on some basic concepts of superset. 

* Superset is a tool for creating dashboards. Dashboards are composed by _Charts_. 
* A chart is a graph that displays a some data that comes from a dataset. 
* A dataset is a subset of the data that can be found in a database such as a table or, in our case a parquet file.
* A database is just a collection of tables, or in our case, a folder of parquet files.

If you take a look at the top navigation bar of superset, you will see precisely those items: Dashboards, Charts and Datasets.

Now that we have some basics, let's create our dashboard: 

1. Click on **Dashboards** at the top navigation bar, and then click on the ** + Dashboard** button

    ![Dahsboards, new dashboard screenshot](../images/get-started/superset-new-dashboard.png)
    .

2. Click on the **+ Create new chart**

3. In the new screen, click on **add dataset**

    ![Create chart page screenshot](../images/get-started/superset-create-chart.png)
    .
4. Using the drop-downs, fill the data as in the image below:
    * Database: `Apache Drill` (the one we just created earlier)
    * Schema: `s3.data`
    * Table: `deployment_countries.parquet`

    ![create the dataset screenshot](../images/get-started/superset-add-dataset.png)
    .
5. Click on **Create dataset and create chart** button

6. In the list of chart types, select the **Bar chart**, and then **Create new chart**

    ![Select the bar cahrt](../images/get-started/superset-create-chart-select-chart.png)
    .

7. Fill the data as in the image below:
    * X-Axis: deploymentCountries: The main column in the X axis
    * X-Axis sort by: COUNT_DISTINCT(name) - We're goint to sort them by counting the DPGs deployed for each country
    * Uncheck the X-Axis sort ascending -- So we see first on the left the country with more DPGs deployed.
    * Row limit: 10 -- this will limit the number fo countries displayed to 10 (top ten)

8. Click on **Update chart** button.

9. Click on **Save** at the top right corner

    ![Filling the chart data](../images/get-started/superset-chart-edition.png)
    .
10. In the dialog box, give it a name and click on **Save & go to dashboard**

    ![Save chart](../images/get-started/superset-save-chart-dialog-box.png)
    .

-----
**Congratulations!** You have added your first chart to your dataset.

-----
As an exercise you can complete the dashboard and add some more charts so it looks like this image:

  ![Superset Dashboard](../images/get-started/superset-final-dashboard.png)


Alternatively, you can import it:

1. Download the file [dpga-superset-dashboard.zip](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/tree/main/examples/dpga-superset-dashboard/dpga-superset-dashboard.zip).

2. In Dashboard, import the dashboard:

## Awesome!

Excellent, you have completed this getting started, in the course of it, you were able to explore a dataset, create a pipeline and present your insights in a nice dashboard.


## What's next

Magasin is composed by several mature open source components, mastering and setting them up to fulfill your organization requirements may require some time and practice.

* [End user guides](../user-guides/). If you want to learn more about from an end user perspective on how to use some of the components of magasin.
 
* [Custom deployment and setup](../deployment.qmd). This documents has useful  references if you need to learn more on how to deploy magasin within your organization.
