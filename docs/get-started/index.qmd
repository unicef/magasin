Magasin is a scalable end-to-end data platform based on open-source components that is natively run in a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io).

In this getting started you will install magasin on your local machine for testing purposes, then you will perform an [end-to-end data processing task](tutorial-overview.qmd) that involves: [exploratory analysis](exploratory-analysis.qmd) of a data source, [creating a pipeline](./automate-data-ingestion.qmd) to automate data ingestion and [authoring a dashboard](create-a-dashboard.qmd) to present your findings.

Let's start by getting the pre-requisites:

## Pre-requisite: a Kubernetes cluster

Prior to installing magasin,  you need to have a Kubernetes cluster. But don't worry, you can setup one on your local machine very easily. In layman terms, Kubernetes is just a technology that enables managing cloud ready applications, such as magasin. 

In this getting started tutorial, we are going to setup a Kubernetes cluster through [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), an application that can be installed on most computers. However, if you already have a cluster you can go directly to the [install magasin section](#install-magasin). 

First, install Docker Desktop. It is available for: 

* [GNU/Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
* [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Once installed. Go to **Settings / Kubernetes **, and enable Kubernetes. It will automatically install everything required, including the command line utility `kubectl`.

Lastly, on a command line, create the new cluster and use it:

```sh
kubectl config set-context magasin --namespace default --cluster docker-desktop --user=docker-desktop
kubectl config use-context magasin
```

To ensure that the kubernetes cluster is the correct one check if the name corresponds to the
```sh
kubectl get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   48m   v1.28.2
```

```sh
kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   49m
kube-node-lease   Active   49m
kube-public       Active   49m
kube-system       Active   49m
```

Alternatively, you can also [install minikube](../install/setup-kubernetes.qmd#option-2-local-cluster-using-minikube) or if you have a cluster in any [cloud provider](../install/setup-kubernetes.qmd#setup-a-cluster-in-a-major-cloud-provider) you can also use it. At the end, you just need your `kubectl` to be setup to use whatever kubernetes cluster you want to use.


## Install magasin

Magasin includes an installer script that sets up all the necessary dependencies on your computer, enabling the seamless setup within the Kubernetes cluster.


:::{.callout-warning}
It is highly recommended to [take a look at the installer script](https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh) before running as it will install several components on your system.

You should run curl-bashing (curl piped with bash/zsh) only on providers that you trust. If you're not confortable with this approach, proceed with the [manual installation](../install/manual-installation.qmd).
:::

For **GNU/Linux Debian like**

  ```sh
  curl -X https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh | bash
  ```

For **MacOS devices**

 ```sh
  curl -X https://unicef.github.io/magasin/install-magasin.sh | zsh
  ```

For **Windows** check the documentation for [manual installation](../install/manual-installation.qmd)

For **other systems** please check the documentation for [manual installation](../install/manual-installation.qmd)

Note that the installation may take some minutes depending on the internet connection speed of the machines running the cluster (mainly because of the container images).

## Verify everything is working

After running the setup you can confirm that all the pods in the magasin-* namespace are in status `Running` or `Complete` 

```sh
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces 
NAMESPACE          NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS        AGE

If you have any issue, check the [troubleshooting section](../install/troubleshooting.qmd)


:::{.callout-important}
The default installation is fine for testing purposes, but for a production environment you should follow the [production deployment guides](../deployment.qmd)
:::

## Next steps

Ok, now you have a fully running instance of magasin in your Kubernetes cluster, so what now:

* **[Start using magasin](../get-started/tutorial-overview.qmd)**. We have created a tutorial that will take you through the typical steps for creating an end-to-end data processing pipeline and consequently for enabling a data-driven organization using magasin.

* Also, you can [learn more about the components and architecture of magasin](../architecture.qmd). Learn more about the the different components that come out of the box with magasin.
