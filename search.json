    "text": "1.1 Branch strategy\nBranching in each repository will follow a trunk-based model. This model involves one eternal “trunk” called master or main from which all other branches originate.\nAll development work will take place on these branches and will be committed to master via pull requests with mandatory approval/review.\nThe goal of this approach is to have a highly stable codebase that is releasable on demand at all times.\nThe additional branches will be created for each feature, release, or hotfix. Each of these branches will have specific purposes and follow strict rules as to how they should be used. At a high level, the branching rules are described as follows:\n\n\n\nBranch type\nBranch from\nMerge to\nNaming convention\nExample\n\n\n\n\nfeature\nmain\nmain\nfeature/&lt;desc&gt;\nfeature/my-feature\n\n\nfix\nmain\nmain\nfeature/&lt;desc&gt;\nfeature/my-feature\n\n\nrelease\nmain\n-\nv&lt;semver&gt;\nv1.0.0\n\n\nhotfix\nmain\nmain, release\nhotfix/&lt;desc&gt;\nhotfix/my-fix\n\n\n\nThe purpose and correct usage of each supporting branch is elaborated in the following sub-sections. The below graphic can be used as an example of a complete workflow involving all branch types.\n\n\n\nBranch strategy flow\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Feature branches\nFor each new feature, or for updates to a given feature, a separate branch will be created. Feature branches must originate from the master branch. Since no development takes place on the master branch, feature branches are expected to be the most common type of branch.\nHowever, these branches should be short-lived. They will exist only as long as the feature is under development and never longer than a sprint. Ideally, a feature branch should involve one developer over a few (1-3) days of work.\nProduct backlog items (issues) should be defined with this in mind — if work on a feature is taking too long, then the item needs to be scoped differently (see the section on Delivery).\nOnce a feature branch is merged to master via pull request, it should be deleted. Any future work, even if it is related, will require a new branch.\nWhenever a feature branch is created, it should be related to an existing issue. Whereas issues will be tagged with the classification (bug, enhancement, etc), the naming of the feature branches is more free.\n\n\n1.1.2 Release branches\nRelease branches will be created for each version of the source that is destined for production release. This enables all preparation work for an upcoming release to take place even while development work for future releases is committed to the master.\nThe creation of a release branch will always correspond to an upcoming deployment. Since the master branch has a high standard of stability, it should be rare that further development work is needed to refine a release for production. If such a need arises, it will follow the hotfix strategy defined below.\nRelease branches never merge back into the trunk. A release branch should be representative of a release at a given point in time. There is no mandatory end of life for a release branch. These branches can exist indefinitely, as marker in release history and for potential rollback should the need arise.\nRelease branches follow the semantic version naming convention (i.e 1.0.0, 1.1.0). When a release branch is created it is also tagged with the same name.\n\n\n1.1.3 Hotfix branches\nHotfixes are small changes that need to be released to production more quickly (e.g. due to the severity of the issue). As with release and feature branches, they should always originate from master.\nUpon completion of the work, a hotfix branch will be merged into master. If the hotfix is also required in a release branch to be brought to production immediately, the change can be cherry-picked upon being merged into master. If no current release branch exists, one should be created for this purpose.\nOnce the corresponding pull requests complete, the temporary hotfix branch should be removed.\nWhenever there is a hotfix merged into a release branch, the commit that includes the fix shall be tagged updating the PATCH number, for instance, changing from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.\nThis approach allows to provide long term support to a particular version.",

    "section": "1.2 Pull requests and commits (PR)",
    "text": "1.2 Pull requests and commits (PR)\nThe merging of supporting branches (feature and hotfix) into the master branch will always require a pull request.\nPull requests should include a reference to the issue numbers either in the commit or in the description of the PR. in the commit comment, using the following convention (where 0000 is the issue number and &lt;comments&gt; is placeholder for any optional comments).\n&lt;comments&gt; #0000 &lt;comments&gt; \nUsing comments like this will ensure that the pull request is automatically linked to all related issues.\nWhen submitting a pull request ensure:\n\nWell-formatted code*: Ensure that the committed code adheres to established coding standards and is well-formatted. Consistent indentation, proper naming conventions, and clean formatting improve code readability and maintainability.\nNo debugging or temporary code: Avoid including debugging statements, temporary code, or commented-out blocks. These can clutter the codebase and make it harder for others to understand and maintain the code.\nAvoid unrelated changes: The PR should focus on a specificfeature. Avoid including unrelated changes in a single commit. If you have multiple unrelated changes, consider creating separate PR for each change.\nNo Sensitive information: Ensure that commits do not include any sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data. Such information should be securely managed outside of the code repository.\nConsistency: Maintain a consistent style and structure throughout the project. Consistency helps establish good coding practices and makes it easier for the team to understand and collaborate on the codebase.\nDocumentation update: Ensure that the code, scripts, documentation and README files are up to date.\n\nCommit messages shall help the reviewer to understand what are the changes that have been introduced and the should tell the reviewer what changes have been introduced. These are properties that commits shall have:\n\nAtomicity: Commits should be atomic, meaning they should represent a single logical change. It’s best to keep each commit focused on a specific task within the PR. This allows for easier code review, debugging, and reverting if necessary.\nClarity and descriptive messages: Commit messages should be clear, descriptive, and concise. They should summarize the purpose and content of the commit. A good commit message helps others understand the changes at a glance and provides context for future reference.\nExample. Too generic not descriptive message ``` ❌ Avoid Updates Readme\n✅ Better Add CONTRIBUTING link to Readme ```\nLogical progression: Commits should follow a logical progression, building upon previous commits. Each commit should leave the codebase in a stable and working state, ensuring that others can pull changes without introducing errors.\n\n\n1.2.1 Approvals\nCompletion of pull requests on main be generally restricted to designated approvers. The job of the approvers is to diligently review all code being merged to master to ensure the utmost stability of that branch.\nReviewers shall ensure the quality of the code, style and documentation. They shall ensure that it follows the practices of the commits and pull requests exposed on this document.\nTheir aim should be to maintain a release-ready main branch at all times.",

You can get the password from the secret superset-env within the same namespace.\nThe output of running this script is the file superset_dump.sql in the current working folder.\nNote that this script assumes that the name of the database is superset.\nAlternatively, these are the manual steps to do the same:\n1.Launch a terminal in the posgresql pod (replace the namespace if required)\n```shell\n kubectl exec superset-postgresql-0 -ti --namespace magasin-superset -- /bin/bash\n```\n\nWithin the pod shell, extract and compress the data.

    "text": "2 Magasin realms\nCompared with most of applications that are distributed using helm charts, instead of defining one unique chart that includes all the dependencies, magasin defines an indepenedent chart for each component. This results in loosely-coupled architecture which allows you to only setup and use the components that fit your organizational needs.\nWhen deploying a containerized application in Kubernetes using Helm charts, typically, a singular chart is defined. This chart can actually be composed of multiple sub-charts, which allows for a hierarchical structure within the deployment. This setup often leads to a well-defined architecture, beneficial for many scenarios, as it simplifies management and deployment.\nGiven that magasin setup uses independent charts, there is a need to setup at least one connection between these independent charts. This is done through a consistent naming convention which defines the concept of magasin realms.\nA realm is a way of linking independent helm charts through namespaces that follow consistent naming convention: --.\nBy convention, the default realm only has the prefix magasin and no postfix. For example, the namespace for the component drill that belongs to the default realm is magasin-drill.\nThe realm name is the concatenation of the prefix and the postfix, both separated by an hyphen - (if the postfix is not empty). Examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealm\nRealm prefix\nRealm postfix\nComponent “drill” namespace\n\n\n\n\nmagasin\nmagasin\n-\nmagasin-drill\n\n\nmagasin-dev\nmagasin\ndev\nmagasin-drill-dev\n\n\nmagasin-new-version-dev\nmagasin-new-version\ndev\nmagasin-new-version-drill-dev\n\n\n-dev\n-\ndev\ndrill-dev\n\n\n\nA realm prefix can have - as part of its names, but not the realm postfix. In the realm name, the last - specifies the start of the postfix.\nIf a realm name starts with - it only has a postfix.\nThe concept of realms allows us setup supporting tools that can make use of two independent helm charts",

    "text": "4 Customizing the setup of each component\nHelm charts allow you to customize some parameters such as the number of replicas, image version to load, startup script parameters, authentication schemas, etc. In order to do that you can create what is called a values file.\nThe installer allows you use custom values file for each component. By default it searches in the current working directory (./) for files that have the name &lt;component&gt;.yaml. That is dagster.yaml, drill.yaml, superset.yaml, daskhub.yaml.\nFor example, by default the Apache Drill helm chart launches two replicas of its main server. You can change the number of replicas by changing the drill.count value you can create the file drill.yaml with the following contents:\n# drill.yaml\ndrill:\n  count: 1\nNow, if you run the installer in the same folder where you stored the drill.yaml file:\ninstall-magasin.sh\nYou’ll see in the logs something like:\n...\n i Installing magasin/drill in the namespace magasin-drill.\n ✓ Custom values file for drill exists (./drill.yaml)\n i helm install drill magasin/drill -f ./drill.yaml --namespace magasin-drill --create-namespace \n...\nBelow you have the default values files and the corresponding custom file name:\n\nDagster default values. To overwrite them create dagster.yaml\nApache Drill default values. To overwrite them create drill.yaml\nDaskhub default values. To overwrite them create daskhub.yaml\n9Superset default values](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/helm/superset/values.yaml). To overwrite them create superset.yaml\n\n\n4.1 Setting up different values for different environments\nWhereas for a testing environment you may want to have some values, such as setting to 1 number of replicas of the drill server, for your production environment you may want to have 3 replicas. The -f &lt;folder-path&gt; option allows you to select the folder where you have the customized values the specific environment.\nGiven the below structure\n  /\n  |- dev\n  |  |- drill.yaml\n  |\n  |- prd\n     |- drill.yaml\n     |- dagster.yaml\n     |- superset.yaml\nNow, you can deploy magasin for development running:\ninstall-magasin.sh -r magasin-dev -f ./dev\nAnd the production environment by running:\ninstall-magasin.sh -r magasin-prd -f ./prd\nThanks to the concept of realms, you can have both instances even in the same cluster.",
